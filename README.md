Imaging codes using python

There are some codes used for manuplating the neutron imaging data

1- A code for binning the data for small stack of images

2- A code for adding radiographs to one stack

3- A code for adding/averaging all images to one image for each projection

4-A code for creating a mask images for different sample regions and divide them by the stack of images 

These are the scripts that may be needed to correct the neutron imaging data before further anaylsis

Others to be added later
